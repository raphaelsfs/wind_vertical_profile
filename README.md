# wind_vertical_profile
That Python code represents an analysis of the variability of the vertical wind shear for a specific location and considering heights varying from 40 to 250 meters previously measured by a Lidar (Tool used for measuring wind speed).

For this code to run, it is necessary to have the files containing the wind data inside the same folder as the Python code itself.

In the file is still possible to some lines of code containing comments of previous versions, during the development stages, so it will be removed in the near future and to improve the understanding of the code, some comments will be added also.
